# Java Masters Project

The complete code for my Java post-grad course completed in 2016. The project was split into two sections, the raw Java code and the
Java GUI implementation in Swing. 

The project focused on taking DNA strings and converting them into their different RNA composites, I had to run all possiable frames 
to be displayed and saved. 

It was a challenging project but it allowed me to learn a great deal about how to work in Java on larger projects and gave me a lot 
of experiance in the fundamentals.
